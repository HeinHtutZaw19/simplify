# CSE 416 Portfolio Project : SIMPLIFY - AI Skin-Care Assistant

## ðŸ§´ Problem Statement

Skin care is essential for anyone looking to enhance their lifestyle. While following a basic routine may seem simple, modern beauty products are highly specialized for different skin types. Using the wrong products can be ineffective or even harmful. However, individuals who are unaware of what to doâ€”or are too busyâ€”struggle to build a proper skincare routine that suits their needs.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution

Our solution is an AI-powered application that assists users with their skincare concerns. By leveraging AI image recognition, the app will analyze each userâ€™s skin and recommend personalized self-care routines. Additionally, users can ask skincare-related questions and receive reliable information from an AI chatbot. This ensures that everyone gets fast and trustworthy guidance tailored to their unique needs.
